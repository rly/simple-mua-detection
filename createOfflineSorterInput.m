% The spike waveform data must be contained in a MATLAB cell array of the form
% cellarray[channel]. Within each cell, there must be an array containing the spike
% waveform data for the channel, of the form array[spike][sample]. The number of
% samples in each spike must be identical, but any number of spikes are allowed.
% The values in the array can be interpreted as either microVolts, or as ADC counts.

% Similarly, the timestamps must be contained in a MATLAB cell array the form
% cellarray[channel], where each cell must contain an array timestamps[spike]. The
% number of channels must match between the spikes cell array and the timestamps
% cell array, and also the number of spikes in the within-cell arrays must match
% between the spikes and timestamps arrays for each channel. The timestamp
% values can be interpreted as either Seconds, milliSeconds, or Clock ticks.
